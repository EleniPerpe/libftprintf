libftprintf is a custom implementation of the printf function, designed to mimic the behavior of the original printf() from the C standard library. This project reimplements printf() using variadic arguments and supports multiple format specifiers such as %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%. The goal of this project is to gain experience in handling variadic functions, formatting output, and understanding how the original printf() works.
